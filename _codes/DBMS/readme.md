Create table     CREATE table table_name2. Save table to file3. Get **data type** of the information from the user at run time.    * int    * double    * char    * string    all the above types are supported         List of SQL Operations supported1. SELECT : user can select which fields of information from the table to be displayed            ` SELECT *` // * implies all coloumns.    * SELECT col1, col22. FROM : It handles the table from which information needs to be provided    * FROM table_name3. WHERE : It helps to filter specific records from the table    * **relational operators supported**    * = equal to, returns records with the value equal to provided    * != not equal to, returns records with the value not equal to provide    * < lesser than, returns records with the value lesser than provided     * \> greater than, returns records with the value greater than provided       * <= lesser than, returns records with the value lesser than or equal to provided    * \>= greater than, returns records with the value greater than or equal to provided    * **logical operators supported**    * AND, returns the records which satisfies both the constraints     * OR, returns the records which satisfies either or the other constraints    * NOT, returns the records which didn't satisfy the constraint    all the above operators and operations are supported.    * WHERE col1 \<relational operator> val    * WHERE \<logical operator> col1 \<relational operator> col2           `WHERE NOT age >= 45 AND gender = f OR city = chennai`4. ORDER_BY : sorts the list in ascending order by default.    * DESC, sorts the list in descending order            ` ORDER_BY emp_id`              `ORDER_BY emp_id DESC `             ```SQL    ex :         SELECT *         FROM employees        WHERE join_yr < 2012 AND NOT gender = f OR city = chennai        ORDER_BY emp_id DESC    ```5. HELP :    * HELP ALL : lists all suported commands   * HELP <command> : displays information about the specified command     6. OPEN : OPEN <file_name> , loads Table from the file.   7. ADD : adds records to the Table.8. DELETE : delets a record from the Table     </details>
