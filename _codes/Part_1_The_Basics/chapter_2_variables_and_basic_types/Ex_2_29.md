### Exercise 2.29: Uing the variables in the previous exercise, which of the following assignments are legal? Explain why.    (a) i = ic;          //  ok : assigning just copies the value, dont change, so const is ignored    (b) p1 = p3;         //  error : p3 is a const pointer to const int, but p1 is pointer to int     (c) p1 = &ic;        //  error : p1 is a pointer to int, where as ic is const int    (d) p3 = &ic;        //  ok : p3 is initialised with address of ic    (e) p2 = p1;         //  ok : p2 is const pointer to a int, p1 is a pointer to a int    (f) ic = *p3;        //  ok : if initialised with *p3, error : if we are trying to change ic
