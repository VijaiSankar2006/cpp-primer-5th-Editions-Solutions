### Exercise 2.31: Given the declarations in the previous exercise determine whether the following assignments are legal. Explain how the top-level or low-level const applies in each case.r1 = v2;                error : cannot assign const int to no const int reference      p1 = p2;                error : p2 has low level const where as p1 doesn't have one p2 = p1;                ok : p1 is just plain int pointerp1 = p3;                error : p3 has low level const where as p1 doesn have one, top level const in p3 is ignoredp2 = p3;                ok : both p2 and p3 have low-level const, top level const in p3 is be ignored
