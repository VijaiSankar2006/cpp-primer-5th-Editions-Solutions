### Exercise 2.37: Assignment is an example of an expression that yields a reference type.The type is a reference to the type of the left-hand operand. That is, if i is an int, then the type of the expression i = x is int&. Using that knowledge, determine the type and value of each variable in this code:    int a = 3,     b = 4;    decltype(a) c = a;        //    type is int      decltype(a = b) d = a;    //    type is int &, as 'a = b' is an expression, where assignment yields a reference type
