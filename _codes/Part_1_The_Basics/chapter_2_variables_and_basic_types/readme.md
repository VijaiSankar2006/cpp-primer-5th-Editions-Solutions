### Assigning out of range value to a unsinged integer    value wraps around the range     (ie) unsigned char ch; ( 0 - 255 )    ch = 256 = 0;    ch = 257 = -1;    ch = -1 = 255;    ch = -2 = 254;    ---------------------### Assigning out of range value to a singned integer    The result is undefined, even if the program works it is not guaranteed to work the same.# Undefined behaviour :    even if program compiles, it is not guaranteed to work the same with compiler updates or other compilers. It is always in error# Implementation defined :    using something that is implementation defined makes the program un-portable. For example sizeof(int) is not same across machines, as compiler vendors can free in implementation- Both *undefined behaviour* and *implementation defined* should be avoided in programs.# Implicit type conversionswhen **signed** and **unsigned** is mixed in an expression, *signed* is always converted to *unsigned*          unsigned int m = 10;          int n = -1;           m + n != 9;          m + n = wraps around the range of unsigned int.       # Literals## integer literal      decimal, octal and hexadecimal literals.

But indepth it is as follows > **declaration** consists of **base type** followed by a list of **declarators**, each declarator names a variable and gives the variable the type that is related to the base type. ### Reference> ***reference*** is a another name to an existing object, when we define a reference the declarator will be of the form > &d, where '&' is a type modifier> when we *initialise* a reference we bind the reference to its initialiser, and there is no way we can rebind the  reference to another object, therefore a reference should be initialised.> reference is not an object, its just a name alias, so we cannot have a pointer to reference and no array of references, as reference doesn't have a address.### Pointer > ***pointer*** are types that point to another object. a pointer can point to> to an **object**> to a location just **immedietly past** the object> can be a **nullptr**, will point to no address> an invalid pointer, which is not the above three    declarator will be of the form *p, where '*' is a type modifier> as pointer is an *object*, we can have reference to a pointer>> int *&r = p, where r is reference to a pointer that point to an object of type int>> r gives the address stored in the pointer>> *r deferences the pointer which in-turn yields the object# Top-level const and Low-level const> *pointer* is an object that can point to different object, so we can speak whether pointer is const or object is const indepently> when *pointer* itself is *const*, it is **top level** const.> when *pointer* can point to a *const object*, it is **low level** const>> ## Top-level const>> when the object **itself** is const, it can be>> 1) built-in type>> 2) compound type - pointer, reference>> 3) class type>> ## Low-level const     >> when the pointer can **point to const object**, it appears in ***base type*** of compound types like pointers, references       >> - const int *p, const is low level const      >> - const int *const p, p has both low level and top level const     >> - simply, in types **reference to const** and **pointer to const** , const is lowlevel       >> - as references are not objects, there is no const reference, so const is always low level.      ***top level, low level*** matters only when we copy object.        >> - when we copy an object, top level is *ignored* as copied object is *not modified*       >> - but if copied object is low level const qualified, then the copying object needs to be low level qualified ## Const-expressions> *const-expressions* are the expressions that can be evaluated at *compile time* > const int j = 32, 42, const int k = j, are const expressions> when we want to define a obect as const, we can make the compiler to verify it by using **constexpr** keyword> **literal types** are the types used to initialise the **variable** declared as constexpr.>> arithmatic, pointer, references are literal types > for the pointer to be a constexpr, the address that it is initialised must be a **fixed address**> objects defined with in functions dont have address fixed, but variable defined ***outside all functions*** and defined as static have fixed address > constexpr functions can be used to initialise.> const int *p, constexpr int *p, are not same as constexpr implies a top level const by default, so> - const int *p, p is pointer to const int, const is lowlevel> - constexpr int *p, p is const pointer to int       ## Type alias> **type alias** is another name to the type, it can be created in two ways        > 1) **typedef**    typedef double rupees               here rupees is another name to double            typedef double price, *d_ptr        price is another name double,                                           d_ptr is another name for double *, '*' is a typemodifier, it modifies the base type  > 2) **using**            using rupees = double             using d_ptr = double *      > we can use **type alias** where ever type name is expected    rupees salary, cost_price, *interest;
