###     Exercise 3.12: Which, if any, of the following vector definitions are in error? For those that are legal, explain what the definition does. For those that are not legal,explain why they are illegal.    (a) vector<vector<int>> ivec;           //  legal : it creates an empty vector of vector of ints, (ie) it is a                                                 vector whose element type is itself a vector which will contain element                                                 of type int.         (b) vector<string> svec = ivec;         //  illegal : we cannot initialise a vector of strings from vector of int         (c) vector<string> svec(10, "null");    //  legal : svec has 10 elements with a value "null";
