### Exercise 3.13: How many elements are there in each of the following vectors? What are the values of the elements?(a) vector<int> v1;                 //  v1 is an empty vector, no elements(b) vector<int> v2(10);             //  v2 has 10 elements of type int, all value initialised to 0(c) vector<int> v3(10, 42);         //  v3 has 10 elements of type int, with value 42(d) vector<int> v4{10};             //  v4 is list initialised with one element of type int with value 10(e) vector<int> v5{10, 42};         //  v5 has two elements with values 10,42 -- list initialisation (f) vector<string> v6{10};          //  v6 has 10 elements each of which is an empty string(g) vector<string> v7{10, "hi"};    //  v7 has 10 elements of value "hi"
