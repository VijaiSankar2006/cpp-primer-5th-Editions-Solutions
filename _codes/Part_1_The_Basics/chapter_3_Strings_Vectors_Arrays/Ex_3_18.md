### Exercise 3.18: Is the following program legal? If not, how might you fix it?     vector<int> ivec;               ivec[0] = 42;          >   illegal : we are accessing an empty vector, ivec[0] does not exist, it leads to undefined behaviour      >   fix :   ivec.push_back(42), push_back - a member function of vector pushes 42 at end of ivec
