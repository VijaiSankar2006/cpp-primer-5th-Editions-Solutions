### Exercise 3.34: Given that p1 and p2 point to elements in the same array, what does the following code do? Are there values of p1 or p2 that make this code illegal?    p1 += p2 - p1;     //   we are calculating the distance of p2 from p1, on adding the difference to p1 we will get p2.                       //   if p2 points to the same array, as the result is nothing but p2.                       //   if p2 points one past the last element in the array, then dereferencing makes the code        illegal, and the value is undefined
