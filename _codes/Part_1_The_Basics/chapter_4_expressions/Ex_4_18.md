### Exercise 4.18: What would happen if the while loop on page 148 that prints the elements from a vector used the prefix increment operator?    while (pbeg != v.end() && *beg >= 0)        cout << *++pbeg << endl;            //  the pointer contained in pbeg would be incremented and the modified pbeg would be returned,which then would be dereferenced    //  the result will be undefined if there is no -ve value, as we dereference the off the end iterator of the vector    //  if there is -ve value it would have been printed,     //  both of these are not what the program wants
