### Exercise 4.19: Given that ptr points to an int, that vec is a vector<int>, and that ival is an int, explain the behavior of each of these expressions. Which, if any, are likely to be incorrect? Why? How might each be corrected?(a) ptr != 0 && *ptr++        //  ptr validity is checked, then ptr is incremented, then we deference the old value of ptr(b) ival++ && ival            //  error: ival is incremented, but the old value is compared with the new value of ival,   (c) vec[ival++] <= vec[ival]  //  error: unexpected results, as we are modifying and refering the same object ival,                              //  '<=' doesn't guaranty the order of evaluation,                              //  ival++ is evaluated first, then vec[ival] <= vec[ival+1] is the result                              //  ival is evaluated first, then vec[ival] <= vec[ival] is the result
