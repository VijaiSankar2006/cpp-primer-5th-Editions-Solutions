### Exercise 4.20: Assuming that iter is a vector<string>::iterator, indicate which, if any, of the following expressions are legal. Explain the behavior of the legal expressions and why those that arenâ€™t legal are in error.(a) *iter++;            //  iter is incremented, then dereferences the old value of iter (b) (*iter)++;          //  error : iter is dereferenced, then string object becomes the operand of ++(c) *iter.empty()       //  error : iter has no member named empty(d) iter->empty();      //  ok : we are accessing the empty() member of the string pointed by iter(e) ++*iter;            //  error : cannot increment a string(f) iter++->empty();    //  ok : accessing empty() member of the string pointed by old iter.
