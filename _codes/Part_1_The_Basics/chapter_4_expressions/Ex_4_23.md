### Exercise 4.23: The following expression fails to compile due to operator precedence.Using Table 4.12 (p. 166), explain why it fails. How would you fix it?string s = "word";                     string pl = s + s[s.size() - 1] == ’s’ ? "" : "s" ;     //  should be 's'    '+' has higher precedence than '==' which has higher precedence than '?:'    so the expression becomes,    string pl = ( (s + s[s.size() - 1] ) == 's' ) ? "" : "s";    so it results in to compilation error, connot convert 's', a char literal to a string literal     it should be parenthasised as    string pl = s + (s[s.size() - 1] == 's' ? "" : "s");
