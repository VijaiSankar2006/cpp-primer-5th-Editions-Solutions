### Exercise 4.34: Given the variable definitions in this section, explain what conversions take place in the following expressions:    (a) if (fval) (b) dval = fval + ival; (c) dval + ival * cval;Remember that you may need to consider the associativity of the operators    bool flag;      char cval;    short sval;     unsigned short usval;    int ival;       unsigned int uival;    long lval;      unsigned long ulval;    float fval;     double dval;    (a) if (fval)                   //  fval is converted to bool    (b) dval = fval + ival;         //  ival is converted promoted float, result is converted to double to assign    (c) dval + ival * cval;         //  cval is promoted to int, then result of ival * cval is promoted to double
