### Exercise 4.35: Given the following definitions,char cval; int ival; unsigned int ui;    float fval; double dval;    identify the implicit type conversions, if any, taking place:    (a) cval = ’a’ + 3;                 //  'a' is promoted to int, then the result of 'a' + 3 is converted to char    (b) fval = ui - ival * 1.0;         //  ival is promoted to double for (ival * 1.0), ui is promoted to double then                                               result is converted to float    (c) dval = ui * fval;               //  it depends on the sizeof ui and fval, but finally the result is converted to                                             double    (d) cval = ival + fval + dval;      //  ival is promoted to float, then the result(ival + fval) is promoted to                                             double, and the final result is converted to char
