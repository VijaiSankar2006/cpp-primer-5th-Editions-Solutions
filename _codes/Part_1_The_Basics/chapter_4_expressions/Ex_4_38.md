### Exercise 4.38: Explain the following expression:    double slope = static_cast<double>(j/i);    i, j are int type. so the result of j/i is int type.    static_cast converts the result to double type to assign to slope which is of double type.    Though the conversion can be achieved by implicit conversion, using static_cast suppressess the warning generated otherwise and it also tells the programmer that narrowing down is done intentionaly.
