### Exercise 4.9: Explain the behavior of the condition in the following if:    const char *cp = "Hello World";         if (cp && *cp)      here, '&&' returs true if both operands are true, as any non-zero value is true,     cp is valid pointer holding the address of string literal("Hello World"), so it converts to true    *cp is 'H' char whose ascii value is a non-zero, so it converts to true    so '&&' returns true
