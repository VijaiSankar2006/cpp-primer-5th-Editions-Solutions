### Exercise 5.16: The while loop is particularly good at executing while some condition holds; for example, when we need to read values until end-of-file. The for loop is generally thought of as a step loop: An index steps through a range of values in a collection. Write an idiomatic use of each loop and then rewrite each using the other loop construct. If you could use only one loop, which would you choose? Why? ##### while construct    char ch;    while( ch = getnext()){        process ch....        .....    }#### for construct    for(char ch; ch = getnext(); ){        process ch....        ......    }    In the above example there is no loop control variable, just the condition terminates the loop     since no initialisation of loop control variable, no incrementation part either     a while() construct is easy to read and represent the logic in a straight forward manner, on the other hand for() is     unnecessary though it can be writen without init-statement, condition, incrementation, a while should be prefered--------------------------------------####  for construct    for( auto beg = container.begin(); beg != container.end(); ++beg){        process beg.....        .......    }####  while construct    auto beg = container.begin();    while(beg != container.end()){        process beg .....        .....        ++beg;    }    In the second example, there is initialisation of loop variable 'beg', condition and incrementation of loop control     variable, for this a for() construct is better, as when we use while() it is easy to forget incrementation of the loop control variable, which will results in to indefinite loop.    So if the condition will eventually fail by reading eof, or invalid input a while() should be used    if there is a loop control variable, a for() is a must as modification of loop control variable needs to be done in for() construct.
