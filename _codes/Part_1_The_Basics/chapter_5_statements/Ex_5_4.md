### Exercise 5.4: Explain each of the following examples, and correct any problems you detect.    (a) while (string::iterator iter != s.end()) { /* . . . */ }            iter is created but not initialised, and iter will be created again in every iteration, this might lead to indefinite loop, it should be        string::iterator iter = s.begin();         while(iter++ != s.end()) { /* . . . */}    (b) while (bool status = find(word)) { /* . . . */ }            if (!status) { /* . . . */ }            return value from find(word) is assigned to status and it is evaluated, but status will be created and initialised with the same return value again and again for every iteration            status variable is used outside the while loop, which is out of scope, so it should be defined outside while        bool status;        while( status = find(word)) {/* . . . */}        if(!status) {/*. . . */}
