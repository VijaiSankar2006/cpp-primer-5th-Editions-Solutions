### Exercise 5.7: Correct the errors in each of the following code fragments:    (a) if (ival1 != ival2)        ival1 = ival2;              // semicolon added        else {ival1 = ival2 = 0; }  // though the code works as intended, a curly braces will make it more readable    (b) if (ival < minval) {        // curly braces are added         minval = ival;          occurs = 1;        }    (c) int ival;                   //  ival is declared outside if as it is used by second if        if (ival = get_value())                 cout << "ival = " << ival << endl;        if (!ival)        cout << "ival = 0\n";    (d) if (ival == 0)              //  '=' was used instead of '=='             ival = get_value();
