### Exercise 6.15: Explain the rationale for the type of each of find_charâ€™s parameters In particular, why is s a reference to const but occurs is a plain reference? Why are these parameters references, but the char parameter c is not? What would happen if we made s a plain reference? What if we made occurs a reference to const?    const string &s    s is a reference to const as the string object might be large, copying is not performance efficient, at the same time, it a const as the funcion is not required to modify the string, and also to prevent any accidental modification, if we made s a plain reference there is no guarantee for s to be unchanged, if s is used somewhere else in the program the results might be a disaster    string::size_type &occurs    occurs is a plain reference as it is used to return the number of times the character occurs to the calling function    if occurs is reference to const, then we won't be able tell the calling function, how many times the character is present, because functions can return only one value, and that return value is first position at which the character is found.    char c    c is not a reference as the function is not required to modify it, the value in c is just used to compare with the contents of the string.
