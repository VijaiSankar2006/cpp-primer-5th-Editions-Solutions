### Exercise 6.24: Explain the behavior of the following function. If there are problems in the code, explain what they are and how you might fix them.    void print(const int ia[10])    {        for (size_t i = 0; i != 10; ++i)            cout << ia[i] << endl;    }    const int ia[10] == const int *ia        ia is a ptr to const int, here the array size is 10 is ignored as this is indeed a const int *        we cannot pass array directly, array name is decayed in to ptr to the 1st element        it can be thought as misleading that it is an array of size 10, but as the function as hardcoded the size as 10 in the for(), it is must to tell the user that an array of 10 const ints should be passed.        - or else it will print all the elements in case of bigger array        - it will access out of bounds for which the result is undefined
