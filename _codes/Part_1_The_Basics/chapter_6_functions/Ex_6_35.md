### Exercise 6.35: In the call to factorial, why did we pass val - 1 rather than val--?    int factorial(int val)    {        if (val > 1)            return factorial(val-1) * val;                return 1;    }    because it will be wrong to refer and modify the same object in an expression, because the order of evaluation is   undefined, so if we use         return factorial(val--) * val; it can be either             return factorial(val-1) * val;             or             return factorial(val) * (val -1);
