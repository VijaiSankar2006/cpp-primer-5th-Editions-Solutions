###  Exercise 6.46: Would it be possible to define isShorter as a constexpr? If so, do so. If not, explain why not.*/    inline bool isShorter(const std::string &s1, const std::string &s2){        return s1.size() < s2.size();    }It is not possible to define isShorter as a constexpr, as the funcion needs to call size() member which is non-constexpr function which will be executed at runtime,      for a function to be a constexpr every objects it creates and every function it calls should be constexpr.
