### Exercise 6.50: Given the declarations for f from page 242, list the viable functions, if any for each of the following calls. Indicate which function is the best match, or if thecall is illegal whether there is no match or why the call is ambiguous.  (a) f(2.56, 42)   (b) f(42)   (c) f(42, 0)   (d) f(2.56, 3.14)    candidate functions :-    void f();    void f(int);    void f(int, int);    void f(double, double = 3.14);    (a) f(2.56, 42) - ambiguous    viable functions :- void f(int, int) , void f(double, double = 3.14)    void f(int,int) - 1st argument need to be converted to int    void f(double, double = 3.14) - 2 argument need to be converted to double    so both viable functions are no better than the other, so this call is ambiguous    (b) f(42)     viable functions :- void f(int), void f(douhle, doubel = 3.14)    void f(int) - exact match    void f(double, double = 3.14) - argument needs conversion    so f(int) is the better match, it will be called    (c) f(42,0) -    viable functions :- void f(int,int) , void f(double, double = 3.14);    void f(int,int) - exact match    void f(double, double = 3.14) - needs conversion    f(int, int) is the better match    (d) f(2.56,3.14)    viable functions :- void f(int,int), void f(double, double = 3.14);    void f(int, int) - needs conversions    void f(double , double = 3.14) - exact match    so void f(double , double = 3.14) is a better match
