### Exercise 6.6: Explain the differences between a parameter, a local variable, and a local static variable.Give a example of a function in which each might be useful.*/**parameter**, parameters are part of the funtion defintion, these are initialised by the arguments supplied by the calling function. life of the parameter ends with the end of function body**local variable**, variables defined inside function body, they are created when execution passes their definitionand destroyed function body ends and the scope is till the block ends, they are created and destroyed every time a function is called. when un-initialised contains undefined value**local static variable**, we can make a local variable live across function calls by defining it as static, the value of the local static variable is preserved when the function ends, their life ends only when the program terminatesvariables un-initialised will be value initialised,
