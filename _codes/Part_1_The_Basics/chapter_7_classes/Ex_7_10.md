###  Exercise 7.10: What does the condition in the following if statement do?     if (read(read(cin, data1), data2))     read() function is writen to imitate input stream operator,>> , which reads data from input stream object and writes to         the data_object and returns a reference to the input stream object, so that we can chain the read operations    here, the inner most read(), reads data from cin and writes to data1 and returns reference to cin.    which becomes the first argument to the outer read(), which now reads data from cin and writes to data2.
