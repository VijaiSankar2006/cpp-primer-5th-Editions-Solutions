### Exercise 7.20: When are friends useful? Discuss the pros and cons of using friends    non-member functions that are part of the class interface normally don't have access to the members that are declared private, as these private members are accessed only by member functions,     a 'friend' keyword is used to declare non-member functions as friends to the class so that they can access the non-public members.    pros :- friend has access to all non-public members,     cons :- friend declaration doen't make it visible to the user code, a seperate declaration is needed outside the class            assuming friend declaration is enough will result in a mess            any change in the implementation part need to accounted in friends definition            breaks encapsulation, exposes the data
