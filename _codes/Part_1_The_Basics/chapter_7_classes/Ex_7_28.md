### Exercise 7.28: What would happen in the previous exercise if the return type of move, set, and display was Screen rather than Screen&?    If the return type is not a reference, then we will be returning a new object as a copy of the original object    any further operations with returned object will not be refering to originial object    s4.display(std::cout).set('&');    it will be like    Screen temp = s4.display(std::cout);    temp.set('&');    temp and s4 are two different objects.
