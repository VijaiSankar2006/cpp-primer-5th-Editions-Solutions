### Exercise 7.30: It is legal but redundant to refer to members through the this pointer.Discuss the pros and cons of explicitly using the this pointer to access members.    cons :        'this' pointer is *implicitly* created by the compiler when a member function is called.           so any reference to the members inside the member function is refering to the members of the object pointed by 'this' pointer, as memeber_name is implicitly converted to this->member_name.            so explicitly mentioning 'this' pointer to refer a member is unnecessary    pros :        It is only useful in two cases        1. when returning the object itself            return *this;        2. when parameter name is same as a member name ( though not a good practice )            T mem_function(P height){                height = heigth;        /** compiler has no way to differentiate,and moreover local names hides names in                    return T;                 *  the outer scope, so it assigns parameter's value to itself            }                             */            correct form is :            T mem_function(P height){                this->height = height;     /** this->height refers to height member of the object pointed by this,                return T;                   *  height refers to the parameter            }                               */
