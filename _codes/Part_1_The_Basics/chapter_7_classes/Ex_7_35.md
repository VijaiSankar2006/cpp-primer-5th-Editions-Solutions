### Exercise 7.35: Explain the following code, indicating which definition of Type or initVal is used for each use of those names. Say how you would fix any errors.    typedef string Type;    Type initVal();    class Exercise {    public:        typedef double Type;            Type setVal(Type);      //  Type : double                                           Type initVal();         //  Type : double    private:        int val;                    };    Type Exercise::setVal(Type parm) {    //   error : Type is string , but val is int, there is no conversion                                                        from int to string    val = parm + initVal();               //   Type should be preceded by class name to use the Type defined in      return val;                                class.    }    /* a class should not redefine a type only after the type is used in the declaration        Type setVal(Type);        typedef double Type;        above line is in error, due to way the name look up happens in class.        first compiler processess all the names in the class as a first step, the compiler has two definitions for the name 'Type'            1. in outer scope            2. inside the class after the name use        so compiler doesn't allow the redefintion        but in the exercise, the second definition found before the use of the name, so it hides the Type definition in the outer scope.    */[stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45384956/why-cant-redefine-type-names-in-class-in-c)
