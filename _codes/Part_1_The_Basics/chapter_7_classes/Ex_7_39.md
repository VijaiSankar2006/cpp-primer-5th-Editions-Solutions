### Exercise 7.39: Would it be legal for both the constructor that takes a string and the one that takes an istream& to have default arguments? If not, why not?    No, it will be illegal for both the constructor that takes a string and the ont that takes an istream& to have default arguments. Because if we have, then when we instantiate an object with no arguments, then the constructor call with no arguments will be ambiguous as both are viable         Sales_data(std::string s = "")        Sales_data(std::istream &is = std::cin)    but none offers a better match, so this call is ambiguous
