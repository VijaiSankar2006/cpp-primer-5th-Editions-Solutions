### Exercise 7.56: What is a static class member? What are the advantages of static members? How do they differ from ordinary members?    Static class member :        static class member is a member which are associated only with the class, not with the object.     Objects don't get to own a member individualy which is defined as static, all the objects share the static member    Advantages :        If we want all the objects of a class to share a common value rather than creating their own copy, they all can share the value which will defined only once        ex :- no of objects created out of a class              interest rate for the customers of a bank        How they differ from ordinary members :        1. They can be used as default values, as they are not owned by any object        2. A class can have a member of same type as the class type of which it is a member by declaring it as static            because static members don't reside in the class memory they are created as global objects, so they don't increase size of a class, so compiler allows such declaration as it doesn't need to know the size of the class until it is used.
