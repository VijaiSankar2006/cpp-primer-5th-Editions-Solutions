# Sequential Containers    A container holds a collection of objects of a similar type. The sequencial containers lets the programmer control the order in which the elements are stored and accessed, but order does't depend on the values instead it corresponds to the    position at which the elements are put in to the container.               vector - flexible sized array                 supports fast random access, subscripts can be used                 insertion or deletion other than the back will be slow        deque  - double ended queue                 supports fast random access,                 fast insertion and deletion at the front and back        list   - doubly linked list                 fast insertion and deletion at anywhere in the container                 no random access, only bidirectional access,  iterates through the elements        forward_list - singly linked list                 sequencial access in one direction                 fast insertion and deletion at any point        array  - fixed sized array                 supports random access                 cannot add or remove items        string - vector like container that stores only characters                 fast insertion and deletion at the back                 fast random access    Any container can hold any type including another container as its elements, But container operations(member functions) imposes their own restrictions for what types they can be used        ex :- a type with no constructor               vector<noDefault> vec1(10, init)  // ok : init is used to construct the elements              vector<noDefault> vec2(10)        // error : as noDefault as no default constructor, vec2 won't be able to                                                                constructs objects
