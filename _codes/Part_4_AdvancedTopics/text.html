Although we could write our program using vector, set, and map directly, itwill be more useful if we define a more abstract solution. We’ll start by designinga class to hold the input file in a way that makes querying the file easy. This class,which we’ll name TextQuery, will hold a vector and a map. The vector willhold the text of the input file; the map will associate each word in that file to theset of line numbers on which that word appears. This class will have a constructorthat reads a given input file and an operation to perform the queries.The work of the query operation is pretty simple: It will look inside its map tosee whether the given word is present. The hard part in designing this functionis deciding what the query function should return. Once we know that a wordwas found, we need to know how often it occurred, the line numbers on which itoccurred, and the corresponding text for each of those line numbers.The easiest way to return all those data is to define a second class, which we’llname QueryResult, to hold the results of a query. This class will have a printfunction to print the results in a QueryResult.
