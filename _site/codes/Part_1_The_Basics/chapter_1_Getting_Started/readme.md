1. **Types** tells us what data can be *stored* and the *operation* that can be performed      2. **byte** the smallest chunk of addressable memory 8 - bits      3. **word** the basic unit of storage, usually smaller no of bytes, either **4 or 8 bytes** , **16 or 32 bits**      4. **Builtin types**- **Arithmetic types**                    - **integral types** char, bool and integers               - **floating types** floating point numbers            >**int :** short, int, long, long long             >**floating point :** float, double, long double             >all these types except char can be *signed* or *unsigned*           **char :** char, signed char, unsigned char, most systems implement only *signed* and *unsigned* where as *char* is implentation defined.
