Exercise 2.1: What are the differences between int, long, long long, and short?       Between an unsigned and a signed type? Between a float and a double?       ---------------------------------------int, long, long long and short are integral types that are used to store whole numbers both -ve and +ve.             the difference is how many bits are used to store the data, though it is compiler dependent, c++ standard guarantees that               - **int** is at least as large as **short**              - **long** is at least as large as **int**              - **long long** is at least as large as **long**             **signed** represents both +ve and -ve numbers             **unsigned** represents only +ve numbers                     **float** is normaly 32 bits and out of which 7 bits are significant bits, float offers less precission than double                        **double** is normaly 64 bits and out of which 16 bits are significant bits
