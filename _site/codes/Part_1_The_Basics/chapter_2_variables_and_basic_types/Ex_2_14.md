### Exercise 2.14: Is the following program legal? If so, what values are printed?    int i = 100, sum = 0;    for (int i = 0; i != 10; ++i)        sum += i;    std::cout << i << " " << sum << std::endl;       // 100 45, as 'i' defined in 'for' hides the 'i' in the outer scope                                                         and its scope ends with 'for'
