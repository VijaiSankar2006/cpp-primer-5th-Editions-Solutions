Exercise 2.2: To calculate a mortgage payment, what types would you use for the rate,      principal, and payment? Explain why you selected each type.       -------------------------       **rate** should be represented by *unsigned double* as we have to store exponential part, and its going to have only *+ve* numbers           **principal** can be represented by *unsigned long* as normaly it is a *+ve whole number*      **payment** since *principal* and *rate* are used to calculate payment, *double* should be used as *rate* is *double*
