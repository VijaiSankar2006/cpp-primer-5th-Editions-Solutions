### Exercise 2.22: Assuming p is a pointer to int, explain the following code:    if (p) // ...    // if p is not a null-pointer, it returns false. Any valid address returns true, if it is invalid                            pointer then the result is undefined    if (*p) // ...   // it yields the objects it points, a non-zero value is true and zero is false
