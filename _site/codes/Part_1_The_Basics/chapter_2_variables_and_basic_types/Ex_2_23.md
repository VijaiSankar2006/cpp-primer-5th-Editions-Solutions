### Exercise 2.23: Given a pointer p, can you determine whether p points to a valid object?If so, how? If not, why not?    a pointer can point to     - an object    - a location immedietly past the object    - a nullptr, that is it points to no address    - an invalid pointer, that is invalid address    so it is not possible to determine whether p points to a valid object.
