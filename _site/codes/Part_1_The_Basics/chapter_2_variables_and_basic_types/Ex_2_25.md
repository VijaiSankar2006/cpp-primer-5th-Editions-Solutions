### Exercise 2.25: Determine the types and values of each of the following variables.    (a) int* ip, i, &r = i;   //  ip is a pointer to int, i is an int, r is a reference to an int type i     (b) int i, *ip = 0;       //  i is int, ip is a pointer to int and initialised to nullptr      (c) int* ip, ip2;         //  ip is a pointer to int, ip2 is an int
