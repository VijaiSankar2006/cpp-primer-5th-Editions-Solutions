### Exercise 2.27: Which of the following initializations are legal? Explain why.    (a) int i = -1, &r = 0;             //  error : non const reference to temp obj    (b) int *const p2 = &i2;            //  error : p2 is const pointer to a non const int but init.. with const int i2    (c) const int i = -1, &r = 0;       //  ok : reference to const can be initialised to a literal    (d) const int *const p3 = &i2;      //  ok : p3 is const pointer to const to a const int    (e) const int *p1 = &i2;            //  ok : p1 is pointer to const int     (f) const int &const r2;            //  error : there is no const reference as it is not an object.    (g) const int i2 = i, &r = i;       //  ok : r is a reference to const to a non const int
