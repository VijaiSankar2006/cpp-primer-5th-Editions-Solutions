### Exercise 2.36: In the following code, determine the type of each variable and the value each variable has when the code finishes:    int a = 3, b = 4;    decltype(a) c = a;          //  type returned is int    decltype((b)) d = a;        //  type returned is int &, as '()' is considered as a expression, a variable is a                                    expression that can be left side of the assignment    ++c;                        //  c = 4    ++d                         //  d = 5
