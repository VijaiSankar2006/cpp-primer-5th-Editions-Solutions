### Exercise 2.38: Describe the differences in type deduction between decltype and auto. Give an example of an expression where auto and decltype will deduce the same type and an example where they will deduce differing types.                    auto                                                         decltype    # compiler deduces the type by evaluating the       ||     # compiler analyses the expression without evaluating       expression.                                       ||       the expression        # top-level const is ignored                        ||       top-level const is not ignored as it is not evaluted     # reference is deduced in to the object, so type    ||     # as reference is not evaluated, the type is reference      is the type of the object                         ||       type    # int i = 0;                                        ||     # int i = 0;      auto j = i;                                       ||       decltype(i) j;      j is int;                                         ||       j is int                          # const int &r = i;                                 ||     # const int &r = i;      auto k = r;                                       ||       decltype(r) k;        k is int, as r yields i which is int              ||       the type of r is int &, k is int &, uninitialisation                                                        ||       is an error
