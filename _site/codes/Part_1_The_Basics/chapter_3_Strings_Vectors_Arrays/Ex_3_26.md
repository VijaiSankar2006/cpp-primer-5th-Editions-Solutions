###  Exercise 3.26: In the binary search program on page 112, why did we write mid = beg + (end - beg) / 2; instead of mid = (beg + end) /2;?  >   **beg + end** will result in out of bounds, (ie) whenever we do arithmatic operations with iterators, the result should point to the element in the container or one past the last element in the container. so **(beg + end)/2** willresult in undefined behaviour     >   **end - beg** gives us the no of elements in the container, same as the **size()** member.
