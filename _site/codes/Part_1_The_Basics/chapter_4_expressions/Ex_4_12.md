### Exercise 4.12: Assuming i, j, and k are all ints, explain what i != j < k means.    '<' has higher precedence than '!=', the expression is 'i != (j < k)'    it means, if 'i' is not equal to what 'j < k' returns,     i != 1, if 'j < k' returns 'true', in that case 'true' will be converted to '1'    i != 0, if 'J < k' is 'false', 'false' is '0'
