### Exercise 4.16: Although the following are legal, they probably do not behave as the programmer expects. Why? Rewrite the expressions as you think they should be.(a) if (p = getPtr() != 0)  (b) if (i = 1024)    if(p = getPtr() != 0)  // '=' has least precedence than '!=', so return value of getPtr() will be compared with '0',                                 and then the result is assigned to p and then the value of p is converted to bool    it should be, 'if( (p = getPtr()) != 0)', now the value of p is compared against '0'    if(i = 1024)    //  '1024' is assigned to i and then i is converted to bool    it should be, if( i == 1024 ) if programmer tries to compare i and '1024' int literal
