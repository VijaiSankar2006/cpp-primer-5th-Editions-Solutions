### Exercise 4.24: Our program that distinguished between high pass, pass, and fail depended on the fact that the conditional operator is right associative. Describe how that operator would be evaluated if the operator were left associative    finalgrade = (grade > 90) ? "high pass": (grade < 60) ? "fail" : "pass";    if it is left assosiative then it would have become    finalgrade = ((grade > 90) ? "high pass" : (grade < 60)) ? "fail" : "pass";    it won't compile as type of "high pass" and (grade < 60) is different
