####    Exercise 4.3: Order of evaluation for most of the binary operators is left undefined to give the compiler opportunities for optimization. This strategy presents a trade-off between efficient code generation and potential pitfalls in the use of the language by the programmer. Do you consider that an acceptable trade-off? Why or why not?>   This is an acceptable trade-off, as the programmer can avoid pitfalls by being carefull as not to include an expression to refer to and change the same object.
