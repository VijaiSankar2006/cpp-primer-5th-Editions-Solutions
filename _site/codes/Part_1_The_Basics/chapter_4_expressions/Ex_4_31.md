### Exercise 4.31: The program in this section used the prefix increment and decrement operators. Explain why we used prefix and not postfix. What changes would have to be made to use the postfix versions? Rewrite the program using postfix operators.    for(vector<int>::size_type ix = 0; ix != ivec.size(); ix++, cnt--)        ivec[ix] = cnt;    as we are not going to use the value returned by post increment operator, it is unnecessary to use it and it is a performance issue    so pre increment is prefered    for(vector<int>::size_type ix = 0; ix != ivec.size(); ++ix, --cnt){        ivec[ix] = cnt;    }
