### Exercise 4.32: Explain the following loop.    constexpr int size = 5;    int ia[size] = {1,2,3,4,5};    for (int *ptr = ia, ix = 0; ix != size && ptr != ia+size; ++ix, ++ptr)    { /* . . . */ }    the condition checks ptr only after it checks ix is lesser than size of the array, though it is unnecessary as ptr is    not dereferenced in the condition, so condition can be either    ix != size             or    ptr != ia + size       both are same
