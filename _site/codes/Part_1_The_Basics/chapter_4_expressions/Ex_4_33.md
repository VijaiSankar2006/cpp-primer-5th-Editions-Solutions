### Exercise 4.33: Using Table 4.12 (p. 166) explain what the following expression does:    someValue ? ++x, ++y : --x, --y    ?: operator has higher precedence than comma operator it is    (somevalue ? (++x, ++y) : (--x, --y))     if someValue is true than x and y are pre-incremented otherwise both x and y are pre-decremented
