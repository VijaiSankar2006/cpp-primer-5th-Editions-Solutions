### Exercise 4.7: What does overflow mean? Show three expressions that will overflow.>   *overflow* means when we try to store a value out of range a type can support, for example         char ch = 127;        ch += 1;    // now when we try to store 128 in ch which maximum value can be only 127, overflow occurs, and the                       // result is undefined    unsigned int num = -34 // here we are assigning -ve value to a unsigned type, so again overflow occurs and the result                            // and the result is undefined    long lnum = 327678910;    short snum = lnum;     // here we are assigning a long int value to a short int, in a machine where short is 16 bits,                           // maximum value snum can take is 32767, so overflow occurs, and result is undefined
