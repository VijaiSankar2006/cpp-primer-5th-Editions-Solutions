### Exercise 5.18: Explain each of the following loops. Correct any problems you detect.    (a) do{                                                 //  sequence of statements should be included in braces            int v1, v2;                                               cout << "Please enter two numbers to sum:" ;              if (cin >> v1 >> v2)                                          cout << "Sum is: " << v1 + v2 << endl;        } while (cin);                                          user has been prompted to enter two numbers, the state of cin is checked to perform the addition via if(), and once the body is executed while() checks the state of cin, if cin is valid the body is executed again or else it exits    (b) int ival;                           //  declaration is not allowed in the condition as it cannot be used in body        do {            // . . .        } while (ival = get_response());              the body is executed until ival gets zero from get_response()    (c) do {            int ival = get_response();  // variables scope ends at the end of the block, ival in while() is out of scope        } while (ival);
