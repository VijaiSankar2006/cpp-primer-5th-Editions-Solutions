### Exercise 5.8: What is a “dangling else”? How are else clauses resolved in C++?    dangling 'else' is a problem, when we nest 'if' inside another 'if' we might end up with more 'if' than 'else',     which 'else' belongs which 'if' is determined by matching unmatched 'else' with closest unmatched 'if'
