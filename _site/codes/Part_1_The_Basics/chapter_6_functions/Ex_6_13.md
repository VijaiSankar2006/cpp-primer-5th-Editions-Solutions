###  Exercise 6.13: Assuming T is the name of a type, explain the difference between a function declared as void f(T) and void f(T&)     void f(T)  // call by value, initialises the parameter with the copy of the argument's value, any change in the parameter's value has no impact in the argument's value     void f(T&)  // call by reference, parameter is a reference, so it gets bound to whatever argument we pass, any change in the parameter's value is the change in the argument's value as parameter is alias name to the argument
