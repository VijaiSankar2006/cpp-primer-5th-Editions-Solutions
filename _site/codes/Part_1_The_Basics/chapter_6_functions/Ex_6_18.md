###  Exercise 6.18: Write declarations for each of the following functions. When you write these declarations, use the    name of the function to indicate what the function does.(a) A function named compare that returns a bool and has two parameters that are references to a class named matrix.(b) A function named change_val that returns a vector<int> iterator and takes two parameters: One is an int and the other is an iterator for a vector<int>-   bool compareMatrixes(const matrix &lhs, const matrix &rhs);-   std::vector<int>::iterator change_val_at_index(int index, std::vector<int>::iterator &beg);
