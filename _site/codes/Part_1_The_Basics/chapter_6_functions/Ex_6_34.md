### Exercise 6.34: What would happen if the stopping condition in factorial were if (val != 0)    int factorial(int val)    {        if (val > 1)            return factorial(val-1) * val;                return 1;    }if we change it to if(val != 0) , then for any non zero value passed factorial() function will return 1
