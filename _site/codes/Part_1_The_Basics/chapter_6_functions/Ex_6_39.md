### Exercise 6.39: Explain the effect of the second declaration in each one of the following sets of declarations. Indicate which, if any, are illegal    (a) int calc(int, int);        int calc(const int, const int);   // illegal : same declaration as the first, top level const is ignored    (b) int get();                  double get();       //  illegal : functions cannot be overloaded based just on return type    (c) int *reset(int *);                      double *reset(double *);    // ok : takes a pointer to double where as the first function takes pointer to int
