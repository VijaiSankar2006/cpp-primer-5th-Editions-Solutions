### Exercise 6.43: Which one of the following declarations and definitions would you put in a header? In a source file? Explain why.    (a) inline bool eq(const BigInt&, const BigInt&) {...}  //  compiler needs the inline function definition to expand so it must be put in a header    (b) void putValues(int *arr, int size);    //   it is normal function so should be put in a source file
