### Exercise 6.53: Explain the effect of the second declaration in each one of the following sets of declarations. Indicate which, if any, are illegal.    (a) int calc(int&, int&);                           int calc(const int&, const int&);    // legal : parameters are reference to const, arguments of const type and                                                         low-level const type can be called with only second declaration not the first        (b) int calc(char*, char*);        int calc(const char*, const char*); // legal : pointer to const parameters, arguments of const type and low level                                                         const type can be called with only second one not the first    (c) int calc(char*, char*);             // illegal : second declaration adds top level const, which is ignored in             int calc(char* const, char* const);               function matching, so both the declarations are same
