###  Exercise 6.54: Write a declaration for a function that takes two int parameters and returns an int, and declare a vector whose elements have this function pointer type.    int fuction(int, int);   // function declaration    typedef int (*fp)(int , int);  //  fp is pointer to function, declared by using typedef    using fp = int (*) (int, int); //  fp is pointer to function, declared using 'using'    typedef decltype(function) *fp  // f is pointer to function, declared using decltype    std::vector<fp> fpvec;    // fpvec is a vector of type fp, which is a pointer to function which takes two int                                  parameteres and returns a int type
