### Exercise 7.18: What is encapsulation? Why is it useful?    encapsultion enforces the implementation and interface part to be seperate, users of the class only have access to the     interface but the implementation is hidden from them        It is useful, as the programmers can think abstractly on how to use the class rather than how to define one, if a class is not encapsulated, users might alter the definition of the class, which might result undefined behaviour.
