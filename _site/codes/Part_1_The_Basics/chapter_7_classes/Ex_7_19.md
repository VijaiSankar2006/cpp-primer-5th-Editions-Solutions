### Exercise 7.19: Indicate which members of your Person class you would declare as public and which you would declare as private. Explain your choice.    class Person{    public :        Person() = default;                     // default constructor        Person(std::istream &is) {              // constructor that uses read function to prompt the user             read(is, *this);        }        Person(const std::string &name_p, const std::string &address_p) :            name(name_p), address(address_p) {} // constructor that takes a name and a address    private :        std::string name;        std::string address;    };    /*  all the constructors are declared as public, as they form the interface of the class     *  data members 'name','address' are declared as private, as they form the implementation part, which should not be         *  accessed outside the class */
