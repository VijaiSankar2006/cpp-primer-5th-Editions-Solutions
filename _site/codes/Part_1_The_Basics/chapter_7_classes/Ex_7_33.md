### Exercise 7.33: What would happen if we gave Screen a size member defined as follows? Fix any problems you identify.    pos Screen::size() const    {        return height * width;    }    - out of the class, the members and types are out of scope, as class itself is a scope    - once class name is seen in the function definition, the reminder of the definition, parameter list,       and the function body are now in the scope of the class so we can refer members of the class directly with out scope name    - But since return type is seen before class name, if it is type defined in the class, we must specify the           class name to which it belongs       //  correct definition    Screen::pos Screen::size() const{   //  pos is a type defined in Screen class         return height * width;    }
