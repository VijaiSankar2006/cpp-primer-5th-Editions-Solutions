### Exercise 7.34: What would happen if we put the typedef of pos in the Screen class on page 285 as the last line in the class?    all the declarations inside a class are processed as the first step, so any name used in the declarations should be seen before the declarations or in the enclosing scope before the point of declaration        so if we put the typedef of pos as last line in the class, then none of the members and function declarations can use the pos type    so         pos cursor = 0;             //  error : pos not declared        pos height = 0, width = 0;  //  error : pos not declared    will be in illegal
