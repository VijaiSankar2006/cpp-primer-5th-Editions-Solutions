### Exercise 7.36: The following initializer is in error. Identify and fix the problem.    struct X {        X (int i, int j): base(i), rem(base % j) { }        int rem, base;    };    error : member are initialise in the order they are in the class definition, the order of constructor initialiser list is not cosidered,     so         rem, first initialised        base, second initialised        rem(base % j) //    error : base has undefined value    legal form :    struct X {         X (int i, int j): base(i), rem(i % j) { }        int rem, base;    }
