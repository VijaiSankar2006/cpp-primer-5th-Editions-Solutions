### Exercise 7.45: What if we defined the vector in the previous execercise to hold objects of type C?    illegal : Since C has NoDefault as a member, the default constructor has been implicitly deleted by the compiler as there is no default constructor for NoDefault        Even if we explicitly define a default constructor for C, unless it uses parameterised constructor for NoDefault    it won't be able to create a member of NoDefault
