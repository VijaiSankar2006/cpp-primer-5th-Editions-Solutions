### Exercise 7.49: For each of the three following declarations of combine, explain what happens if we call i.combine(s), where i is a Sales_data and s is a string:    (a) Sales_data &combine(Sales_data);        construct which takes a string parameter will be called to construct Sales_data object, then it's value will be passed to combine function.    (b) Sales_data &combine(Sales_data&);        first temporary Sales_data object will be constructed using s, but then since we can't assign a temporary to a non-const reference, the call is in error    (c) Sales_data &combine(const Sales_data&) const;        A const member function cannot modify the object as the type of 'this' is pointer to const.
