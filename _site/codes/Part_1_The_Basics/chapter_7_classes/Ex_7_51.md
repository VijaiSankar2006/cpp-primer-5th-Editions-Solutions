### Exercise 7.51: Why do you think vector defines its single-argument constructor as explicit, but string does not?    if vector constructor that takes a single constructor is not explicit,         then any type that is compatible with size_t will be converted to a vector whenever a vector is expected,        But size_t is integral where as vector is container, so there is no meaning in the conversions of such types to a vector,as vector and arithmatic types are not compatible with each other      As for string, string is a sequence of 0 or n characters which are implemnted in ascii values. so where ever a string is         expected, to send a single character, we can also use a integral type to represent its ascii value.
