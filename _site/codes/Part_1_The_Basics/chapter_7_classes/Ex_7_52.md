### Exercise 7.52: Using our first version of Sales_data from ยง 2.6.1 (p. 72), explain the following initialization. Identify and fix any problems.    Sales_data item = {"978-0590353403", 25, 15.99};    // definition of sales data from section 2.6.1    struct Sales_data {        std::string bookNo;                 unsigned units_sold = 0;        double revenue = 0.0;    };    bookNo = "978-0590353403";    unit_sold = 25    revenue = 15.99    //  only problem is if last value '15.99' is price, then it gets assigned to revenue, so the correction is if and only if we have price instead of revenue, revenue needs to be calcultated, so it should be    Sales_data item = {"978-0590353403", 25, 25 * 15.99};
