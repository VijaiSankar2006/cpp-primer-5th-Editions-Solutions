# THE INPUT OUTPUT LIBRARY    The Input Output Library provides a set of classes to perform input and output operations    HEADERS        1. iostream - input from and output to standard(console) input and output stream         2. fstream - input from and output to name files        3. sstream - input from and output to in-memory string streams• istream (input stream) type, which provides input operations       • ostream (output stream) type, which provides output operations      • cin, an istream object that reads the standard input      • cout, an ostream object that writes to the standard output       • cerr, an ostream object, typically used for program error messages, that writes to the standard error      • The >> operator, which is used to read input from an istream object      • The << operator, which is used to write output to an ostream object      • The getline function (§ 3.2.2, p. 87), which reads a line of input from a given istream into a given string            ![The Input Types](../../pictures/IO_Types)> ifstream and istringstream inherits from istream, so we can use obj of ifstream and istringstream in place of cin        cin << word;    ifstreamobj << word;     istringstreamobj << word    getline(cin, line),     getline(ifstreamobj,line),      getline(istringstreamobj, line);       > ofstream and ostringstream inherits from ostream, so we can these types in place of cout                   cout << word;   ostreamobj << word      ostringstreamobj << word### No Copy or Assign for IO Objects           ofstream out1, out2;    out1 = out2                // error : can't assign stream objects    ofstream print(ofstream )  // error : can't initialise the ofstream parameter type  //  function call    out2 = print(out2)         // error : cannot copy stream objects### No Const    reading and writing changes the state of the subject, so const references### Condition State    The state of a io stream(obj) can be accessed by strm::iostate type - machine dependent integral ![IO State](../../pictures/condition_state_ofIO.png)### Flushing Buffer    cout << "hi" << endl;  //  writes hi and a newline, then flushes the buffer    cout << "hi" << flush; //  writes hi and flushes the buffer    cout << "hi" << ends;  //  writes hi and a null, flushes the buffer    cout << unitbuf;       //  all writes will be flushed immedietly    cout << nounitbuf;     //  returns to normal buffering### fstream    along with all the operations that iostream provides, fstream adds these file specific operations![FILE OPERATIONS](../../pictures/fstreamOperations.png)
