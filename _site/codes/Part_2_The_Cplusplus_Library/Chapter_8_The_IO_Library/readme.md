# THE INPUT OUTPUT LIBRARY    The Input Output Library provides a set of classes to perform input and output operations    HEADERS        1. iostream - input from and output to standard(console) input and output stream         2. fstream - input from and output to named files        3. sstream - input from and output to in-memory string streams• istream (input stream) type, which provides input operations       • ostream (output stream) type, which provides output operations      • cin, an istream object that reads the standard input      • cout, an ostream object that writes to the standard output       • cerr, an ostream object, typically used for program error messages, that writes to the standard error      • The >> operator, which is used to read input from an istream object      • The << operator, which is used to write output to an ostream object      • The getline function (§ 3.2.2, p. 87), which reads a line of input from a given istream into a given string      • istringstream and ifstream inherits from istream, so can be used anywhere we use cin       • ostringstream and ofstream inherits from ostream, so can be used anywhere we use cout               > ifstream and istringstream inherits from istream, so we can use obj of ifstream and istringstream in place of cin        cin >> word;    ifstreamobj >> word;     istringstreamobj >> word    getline(cin, line),     getline(ifstreamobj,line),      getline(istringstreamobj, line);       > ofstream and ostringstream inherits from ostream, so we can these types in place of cout                   cout << word;   ostreamobj << word      ostringstreamobj << word### No Copy or Assign for IO Objects only References          ofstream out1, out2;    out1 = out2                // error : can't assign stream objects    ofstream print(ofstream )  // error : will be considered as function call, stream objects cannot be copied    out2 = print(out2)         // error : cannot copy stream objects### No Const    reading and writing changes the state of the subject, so no const references### Condition State    The state of a io stream(obj) can be accessed by strm::iostate type - machine dependent integral ### Flushing Buffer    cout << "hi" << endl;  //  writes hi and a newline, then flushes the buffer    cout << "hi" << flush; //  writes hi and flushes the buffer    cout << "hi" << ends;  //  writes hi and a null, flushes the buffer    cout << unitbuf;       //  all writes will be flushed immedietly    cout << nounitbuf;     //  returns to normal buffering### fstream    along with all the operations that iostream provides, fstream adds these file specific operations### filemodes    'in' mode is implicit in ifstream, it cannot be used ofstream    'out' and 'trunc' mode is implicit in ofstream, so by default ofstream truncates the file opened unless 'app' mode is specified, if file not present a new file is created, 'out' cannot be specified with ifstream            fstream should be close the file, before bound to other file, if not fstream will set failbit.    modes are reset every time file is opened.    file is implicitly closed when fstream obj gets destroyed at the end of the block    ex :-        while(1){            std::ofstream out(fileName);    //  out is created            out << "some thing"        }   // out gets destroyed        every time the loop iterates out is created and destroyed### sstream - in-memory input output of strings    istringstream, reads  a string    ostringstream, writes a string    stringstream.str() will return a copy of the underlying string and stores a copy of the new string if passed,    # even after extracting all characters from the stream    # even if failbit, eofbit, badbit is set true    # as extraction only moves the pointer, but doesn't modify the string in anyway, so strm will always have the string    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43124746/istringstreamstr-does-not-return-current-contents    https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_istringstream/str       sstream is mainly used to efficiently process numbers converted to and from string
