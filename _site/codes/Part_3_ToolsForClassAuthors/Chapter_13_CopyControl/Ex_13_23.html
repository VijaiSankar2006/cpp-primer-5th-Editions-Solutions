/**
 * though my version works fine in this case, as we directly copy the value pointed by rhs.ps and write in to the memory pointed
 * by the lhs.ps, it won't work if the objects are of array type with different size.
 *      so we have to incultivate the habit of copying the value pointed rhs pointers in to a new dynamicaly alloted memory
 * and destroying the object pointed by lhs pointers and freeing the memory pointed by lhs pointers and finaly assign the
 * new memory to the pointer in the lhs.
 * It has to kept in mind
 *      - Assignment operators must work correctly if an object is assigned to itself
 *      - so always copy the rhs in to local temporary
 *      - once the copy is done successfully, destroy the members of lhs
 *      - once the lhs members are destroyed, copy the data from the temporary into the members of the lhs
