# <p style = "text-align : center; color : grey">OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING </p>**object oriented programming**, method of writing program using **inheritance, data-abstraction, and dynamic binding**       ## INHERITANCE *Inheritance* is concept of defining a class in-terms of another class, where the class that inherits is called **derived class** and the class from which it inherits is called **base class**. When a class inherits from another class, the interface of the base class becomes the part of the interface of the derived class.       ```c++        class Foo {         public :            void greet() {                std:cout << "HELLO WORLD" << std::endl;            }         };         class Bar : public Foo {         public :            void message() {                std::cout << "oops" << std::endl;            }         };         base class : Foo         derived class : Bar         Since class Bar inherits from the class Foo, Foo's public member becomes the public member of Bar. A derived object can use the base class members directly by their name, we can call base class member on a derived object.                  Foo.greet();   //  HELLO WORLD         Bar.greet();   //  HELLO WORLD         Bar.message(); //  oops ```**class derivation list**, list of clas names from which the derived class inherits specified after a colon(:) preceded by derived class name.      ```c++    class Bar : public Foo, public Dummy {           ..../body    };    // class derivation list is what comes after ":", it specifies the names of the base classes and derivation access specifier.```**base class**, the class from which another class inherits.**derived class**, the class which inherits from another class.**direct base class**, class name specified in the class derivation list.**in-direct base class**, class from which the class in the derivation list has inherited.     ```c++    class base {    };    class derived : public base {    };    class derived_from_derived : public derived {    };```    base :         direct base class to the derived class        in-direct base class to the class derived_from_derived    derived :         derived class of base        direct base class to the derived_from_derived class    derived_from_derived :        derived class of derived which itself is derived from base.## ACCESS SPECIFIERS ### member access specifier**private** members of the base class are not accessible to the derived class, or users of the class. Only a friend has access.         **public** members of the base class are accessible to the derived object, users of the class and friend.      **protected** members of the base class are accessible to the derived class and friends of the derived class but not the users of the base class, friend and derived class can access only through a derived object.       ```c++         class Base {            public :                int pub_mem;            private :                int pri_mem;            protected :                int pro_mem;        };                class Derived : public Base{            public :                void show() {                    std::cout << pub_mem   // ok : public member of the base                                << pri_mem   // error : private member of the base                               << pro_mem   // ok : protected member of the base                }        }; ```### Derivation access specifier**private inheritance**, members of the base class whether it is public, protected or private, they all become private members of the derived class.      **protected inheritance**, public and protected members of the base class becomes protected members of the derived class.      **public inheritance**, public members (ie) interface of the base class becomes interface (ie) public members of the derived class.*derivation access specifier* has no effect on whether the members and friends of derived class may access the members of its own direct base class. Access to the base class members is controlled by the access specifiers in the base class itself. derivation access specifier only controls the access to the users, classes that derives from derived class and their friends. ```c++class Base {    public :  //  members, friends, all users - derived class, friends of derived class, general users                      int pub_mem_base;          private :   //  members, friends only        int pri_mem_base;    protected : //  members, friends and "derived class can access through its object"         int pro_mem_base;    friend void friend_of_Base(Base &b);};/*  when a derived class derives through public derivation from base, every member in base is treated like corresponding member in derived *  private of derived = private of derived + private of base *  public of derived = public of derived + public of base *  protected of derived = protected of derived + protected of base */class Pub_Derv : public Base {    public :        int pub_mem_Pub_Derv;

When other members are inherited, derived class may override the virtual function with a type specific behaviour, if it doesn't override, it will be inherited as it is. Derived class overrides the virtual function by defining a function with same name, same parameter list, const and reference qualifiers.     ### static typeType with which a variable is declared or expression yields is called static type of the variable, it will known at compile time.### Dynamic typeType of the object in memory to which the varible or expression represents is called dynamic type of the variable, it will be known at run-time.- static type and dynamic type of a varibles are same except when it comes to inheritance.- static type and dynamic type of a pointer or reference to a base_type can be different- When derived class object is constructed, it will have two parts, one will be derived part subobject(members of the derived class) and another will be base part subobject(that is members of the base class). As because every derived object has base part in it, we can use a pointer or reference to a base class to point a derived object which is derived from that base class. This is known as derived to base conversion.**derived to base conversion** accessiblity is controled by base class (ie) if base class is accessible then derived to base conversion is accessible in simple terms if public member of the base class is accessible, then derived to base conversion is possible.       ## Dynamic binding - Choosing which function to run at **run-time** is called dynamic binding.- When a pointer or reference to a base class is used, the object to which is points in memory will be only known at run-time. When a virtual function is called through a base class pointer or reference, compiler generates a code to know which function to call based on the dynamic type of the object.```c++class base {    public :        virtual void print() const {            std::cout << "base::print" << std::endl;        }};class derived : public base {    public :        void print() const override {            std::cout << "derived::print" << std::endl;        }};int main() {    derived d1;    base b1;    base *p, &r = d1;  //  derived to base conversion, static type = pointer to base, dynamic type = derived type    r.print()  //  calls derived::print()     p = &b1    //  static type and dynamic type are both same, base type    p->print() //  calls base::print()    p = &d1    //  static type is pointer to base, dynamic type is derived type, derived to base conversion    p->print() //  calls derived::print() }```**sliced down**, when a derived class object is assigned to an object of base type, then only the base part contained in the derived object will be assigned, we say the derived object is sliced down.## Abstract base class Base class which has one or more pure-virtual function, is called an abstract base class. We cannot create an object of abstract base class, it can only be created as a part of the derived object. If a derived class doesn't override the pure virtual function from base, then it inherits the pure-virtual which makes the derived class too an abstract base class.     ```c++class abstract_base {    public :            virtual void display() = 0;  //  pure virtual function        void greet() {            .../body        }};class derived : public abstract_base {    public :        void display() {            .../ body        }};abstract_base ab1;   //  error : abstract_base class object cannot be created directlyderived d1;          //  okd1.display()         //  okd1.greet()           //  ok : derived object has the abstract_base subobject in it.   ```**pure virtual function**, a virtual function which is declared as pure virtual function as writing = 0, after the parameter_list of the function.          class Foo {        public :            virtual void display(int n) = 0;   // pure virtual function.    };## PolymorphismWriting type independent programs with type specific behaviour through the use of inheritance and dynamic binding is known as Polymorphism(many forms) (ie) calling virtual functions in a type independent manner through a pointer or reference of the base class.
